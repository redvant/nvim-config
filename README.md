# My Neovim config - WIP

Makes use of [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the plugin manager.
Implements plugins like 
[telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), 
[treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) and 
[lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim).
Has enabled LSP and completions support.
Right now is configured with Lua and Go support.
